A reverse flag (the inverse ANSI code) or some way of saying e.g. show gaps in reverse primary.

Add descriptions for the builtin colorschemes. E.g. what is min and max color for the gradients.

Add gradient support, e.g. from builtin list of properties for each AA, etc. or from a supplied list of numbers.

Ability to auto detect RNA/DNA/AA by seeing that the line is all from one of these alphabets, then choosing colorscheme that's relevant.

Option for highlighting problems, e.g. highlighting X in sequences, yet having the full alphabet defined so the -m flag still works for filtering when X is in a sequence.

Maybe have a separate include and exclude pattern instead of a single regex.
