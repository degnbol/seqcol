Ability to auto detect RNA/DNA/AA by seeing that the line is all from one of these alphabets, then choosing colorscheme that's relevant.

Some way of highlighting problems, e.g. highlighting X in sequences, yet having the full alphabet defined so the -m flag still works for filtering when X is in a sequence.
