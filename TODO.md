Gap should be included by default. It could be dimmed by default. This opens up a whole other ticket of adding more control of fg vs bg, to achieve things like dimming.

Consider ways to improve drawing performance when scrolling side-ways.

Add note to transpose about usefulness.

Add consensus seq capabilities, e.g. options to highlight in bold and/or underline for letters that are consensus or are mutations.

Consider silencing broken pipe warning when exiting pager.

Optional arg for -i/--invisible to hide only some chars, e.g. gaps.

A reverse flag (the inverse ANSI code) or some way of saying e.g. show gaps in reverse primary.

Add descriptions for the builtin colorschemes. E.g. what is min and max color for the gradients.

Add gradient support, e.g. from builtin list of properties for each AA, etc. or from a supplied list of numbers.

Ability to auto detect RNA/DNA/AA by seeing that the line is all from one of these alphabets, then choosing colorscheme that's relevant.

Some way of highlighting problems, e.g. highlighting X in sequences, yet having the full alphabet defined so the -m flag still works for filtering when X is in a sequence.
